The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), ever since its inception in late 2019 has spread all across the world and as a result, led to an increased burden on healthcare professionals due to the urgent need for rapid disease diagnosis and effectuating quarantine protocols. 

Currently, the Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) remains the front runner in terms of COVID-19 diagnosis when compared to other testing mechanisms. 

But there involve serious downsides to using this test as a primary diagnosis tool, a few of them include the shortage in RT-PCR test kits, delays in receiving test results (up to 2 days), but most importantly the low accuracy rate of COVID-19 detection.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a fully automated framework minimizing human to human interaction to rapidly diagnose patients with COVID-19 using medical imagery such as Chest X-ray's or CT scan's applying deep learning techniques and therefore, achieve a much higher accuracy rate compared to the traditional RT-PCR test ultimately reducing the workload on healthcare professionals.
