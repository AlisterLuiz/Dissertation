Abstract- The detection of coronavirus (COVID-19) is now a critical task for the medical practitioner. The coronavirus spread so quickly between people and approaches 100,000 people worldwide. In this consequence, it is very much essential to identify the infected people so that prevention of spread can be taken. In this paper, the deep learning based methodology is suggested for detection of coronavirus infected patient using X-ray images. The support vector machine classifies the corona affected X-ray images from others using the deep feature. The methodology is beneficial for the medical practitioner for diagnosis of coronavirus infected patient. The suggested classification model, i.e. resnet50 plus SVM achieved accuracy, FPR, F1 score, MCC and Kappa are 95.38%,95.52%, 91.41% and 90.76% respectively for detecting COVID-19 (ignoring SARS, MERS and ARDS). The classification model ResNet50 plus SVM is superior compared to other classification models. The result is based on the data available in the repository of GitHub, Kaggle and Open-i as per their validated X-ray images. Keyword- coronavirus, COVID-19, diagnosis, deep features, SVM.
1. Introduction Nowadays, "coronavirus" is frequently introduced with the word "novel," as it is a new strain in the family of viruses, we have all observed previously. As indicated by the WHO, coronaviruses belong to a large family range from the common cold to dangerous diseases [1]. These diseases can infect both humans and animals. The strain that started spreading in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei region, is identified from two different coronaviruses, i.e. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Symptoms of coronavirus contamination go in seriousness from respiratory complication like pneumonia, kidney disorder and development of liquid in the lungs.
On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reported that the infection brought about by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the abbreviation of "coronavirus disease 2019". In the last two decades, two coronavirus epidemics are observed, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The first one started in china, spread to twenty-four countries and reported 8000 cases & 800 of deaths. The second one started from Saudi Arabia, reported 2500 cases and 800 deaths. The detail of coronavirus is depicted in Table 1.

Among the causing pathogens for respiratory diseases, CoV is become the dangerous one because of its serial interval (5 to 7.5) and reproductive rate (2 to 3) [2]. The CoV belongs to single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) family mostly observed in animals [3,4]. The analysis carried out till date, the viruses have no species barrier and can cause severe diseases like MERS and SARS. The coronavirus infection can provoke SARS that is severe enough to be called Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In general, estimates suggest that 2% of the population are healthy carriers of a CoV and that these viruses are responsible for about 5% to 10% of acute respiratory infections [5]. COVID-19 spreads more easily than SARS and have symptoms like other coronaviruses. Figure 1 shows the distribution of COVID-19 cases worldwide, as of 17 March 2020 [6]. Figure 2 shows the distribution of COVID19 cases by continent (except China), as of 17 March 2020 (according to the applied case definition and testing strategies in the affected countries) [6].

Figure 2. Distribution of COVID-19 cases by continent (except China), as of 17 March 2020 (according to the applied case definition and testing strategies in the affected countries).
The test of COVID-19 is currently a difficult task because of unavailability of diagnosis system everywhere, which is causing panic. Because of the limited availability of COVID-19 testing kits, we need to rely on other diagnosis measures. Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyse the health of a patient’s lungs. The medical practitioner frequently uses X-ray images to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes. And almost in all hospitals have X-ray imaging machines, it could be possible to use Xrays to test for COVID-19 without the dedicated test kits. Again, a drawback is that X-ray analysis requires a radiology expert and takes significant time, which is precious when people are sick around the world. Therefore, developing an automated analysis system is necessary to save medical professionals valuable time. The chest X-ray images of COVID-19+ are shown in Figure 1.
In the current situation of the rapid spread of COVID-19 many kinds of research have been going on [7-15]. The deep learning is one of the recent techniques applicable in the field of medicine for diagnosis purpose [16-28].
In this paper, a system based on deep CNNs is developed for the identification of COVID-19 as a classification task. In this study, we prepared two sets of datasets. The first dataset contains 25 number of COVID-19+ and 25 number of COVID-19- X-ray images. The COVID-19+ X-ray images are collected from the GitHub repository shared by Dr. Joseph Cohen, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Montreal [29]. The COVID-19- are the X-ray images of pneumonia collected from Kaggle repository [30]. The COVID-19+ excludes the MERS, SARS, and ARDS. The second dataset contains 133 X-ray images of COVID-19+, including MERS, SARS, and ARDS. In addition, 133 chest X-ray images are collected from the Open-i repository [31] as COVID-19-. The two datasets are examined separately in the proposed models. We use this dataset for deep feature extraction based on deep

learning architectures such as AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet. The deep features obtained from these deep models are classified by SVM. Again, the transfer learning approach is applied for the identification of rice diseases in the aforementioned deep CNN models. Finally, we evaluate the performance results by using deep feature extraction methods. The detail about the dataset is in Table 2.

2. Methodology Deep feature extraction is based on the extraction of features acquired from a pre-trained CNN [32]. The deep features are extracted from fully connected layer and feed to the classifier for training purpose. The deep features obtained from each CNN networks are used by SVM classifier. After that, the classification is performed, and the performance of all classification models are measured. The rice leaf disease identification model based on deep features by SVM classifier is shown in Figure 2.

3. Results and Discussion In this study, we examined the performance of classification models for identification COVID-19+ based on eleven number of CNN models. The experimental studies were implemented using the MATLAB 2019a deep learning toolbox. All applications were run on a laptop, i.e. Acer Predator Helios 300 Core i5 8th Gen - (8 GB/1 TB HDD/128 GB SSD/Windows 10 Home/4 GB Graphics) and equipped with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti. The measurement of performance of each classifier is measured in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, False positive rate (FPR), F1 Score, MCC and Kappa. In addition, this experimentation used One-Vs-all approach and linear SVM as the SVM classifier parameter. The results reported in Table 4 and Table 5 are based on the average value of 100 independent simulations. The training, validation and testing ration is 60:20:20 and adapted randomized selection for training, validation and testing in each execution. The results reported in Table 4 and Table 5 are the cases of coronavirus excluding SARS, MERS and ARDS i.e. only for COVID-19. Note: The result is based on the data available in the repository of GitHub, Kaggle and Open-i as per their validated X-ray images. The author is not responsible if the data uploaded in the repository are incorrect.
