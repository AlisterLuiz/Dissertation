Abstract Purpose: To quantitatively evaluate lung burden changes in patients with COVID-19 using serial CT scan by an automated deep learning method. Materials and Methods: Patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest CT between 1st January 2020 and 3rd February 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into mild, moderate, severe, and critical types, according to their baseline clinical, laboratory, and CT findings. CT lung opacification percentage of the whole lung and five lobes were automatically quantified by a commercial deep learning software, and compared over follow-
s ups CT scans. Longitudinal changes of the CT quantitative parameter were also compared
among the four clinical types.
s Results: A total of 126 patients with COVID-19 (age 52 years ± 15 years, 53.2% males) were
evaluated, including 6 mild, 94 moderate, 20 severe and 6 critical cases. CT-derived opacification percentage was significantly different among clinical groups at baseline,
re gradually progressing from mild to critical type (all P < 0.01). Overall, the whole-lung
opacification percentage significantly increased between baseline CT and 1st follow-up CT (median [interquartile range]; 3.6% [0.5%,12.1%] vs 8.7% [2.7%,21.2%], P < 0.01). No significant progression of the opacification percentages was noted between the 1st follow-up and 2nd follow-up CT (8.7% [2.7%,21.2%] vs 6.0% [1.9%,24.3%], P=0.655).
p Conclusion: The quantification of lung opacification in COVID-19 measured on chest CT by
a commercially available deep-learning-based tool was significantly different among different clinical severity groups. This approach could potentially eliminate the subjectivity in
Inthe initial assessment and follow up of pulmonary findings in COVID-19.

Introduction SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus initially identified in Wuhan, China, which causes a respiratory pandemic disease named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). Chest CT has played a pivotal diagnostic role in the assessment of patients with COVID-19 in China (3).
Recent studies reported that the possible pathological mechanism in COVID-19 is diffuse alveolar damage and inflammatory exudation, which is similar to histologic findings seen in SARS-CoV pneumonia (1,4). The pathological evolution during the course of
s infection in COVID-19 has not been clarified, and the disparity of such changes in patients
with different clinical severities are largely unknown. Chest CT, especially high-resolution
s CT (HRCT), can detect small areas of ground glass opacity (GGO) (5), and, therefore, is a
promising imaging tool for monitoring the disease, if radiation dose is balanced to comply with ALARA principles. It is common practice for radiologists to evaluate the pneumonia
re severity qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by visual scoring (6). Visual evaluation of
changes between two CT scan is subjective and its validity may depend on the radiologists’ experience. Quantitative analysis of the CT scans using artificial intelligence (AI) tool, in particular deep learning, could provide an automatic and objective estimation of the disease burden, facilitating and expediting imaging interpretation during the COVID-19 pandemic
p (7). The purpose of the present study was to assess a quantitative CT image parameter, defined as the percentage of lung opacification (QCT-PLO), calculated automatically using a deep learning tool. We evaluated QCT-PLO in COVID-19 patients at baseline and on follow-
Inup scans, focusing on cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in patients with different
degrees of clinical severity.

Materials and Methods The local ethical review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement to obtain individual informed consent.
Study Population Patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest CT in our department from 1st January to 3rd February 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Inclusion criteria were: (a) positive SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid in double swab tests (within an interval of 2 days, real time RT-
s PCR), and (b) with at least 2 chest CT scans in our hospital, and (c) without confirmation of
another viral infection. Exclusion criteria were: (a) patients who underwent initial chest CT in
s other hospitals, or (b) CT images with respiratory artifacts that could not meet the image
analysis requirement, or (c) inadequate deep-learning segmentation by the segmentation algorithm based on radiologist review, as will be explained in detail later. Figure 1 shows the
re enrollment flowchart. At baseline, all patients were classified into four clinical types: mild, moderate, severe and critical type, based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol of Novel Coronavirus (trial version 5th) (3) from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. The classification criteria of clinical types are described in Appendix E1.
p CT Scanning
Non-contrast enhanced chest CT examinations were performed with three CT scanners (United Imaging uCT, United Imaging Healthcare, Shanghai, China; GE Optima 660, GE
InHealthcare, USA; Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS+, Siemens Healthineers, Germany).
The patients were scanned in supine position during inspiratory breathhold. The scanning range was from apex to the base of lungs. Scanning parameters were as follows: tube voltage

80-120 kV, tube current 50-350 mAs, pitch 0.99~1.22 mm, matrix 512×512, slice thickness 10 mm, field of view 350 mm×350 mm. Reconstruction was performed with slice thickness of 0.625~1.250 mm, a lung window with a width of 1200HU and a level of -600HU, and a mediastinal window with a width of 350 HU and a level of 40HU.
CT Image Analysis Quantitative analysis of lung opacification was performed by a deep-learning algorithm. This algorithm consists of three modules: (a) lung and lobes segmentation module; (b) lung
s opacity segmentation module; and (c) quantitative analysis module. The algorithms used in
(a) and (b) were based on a deep-learning framework to learn the complex relationship
s between diverse features extracted from chest CT scans and regions of interest (lungs, lobes,
and opacities). The deep-learning algorithm in module (b) employed a well-established fully convolutional neural network architecture (8) trained on annotated datasets of COVID-19.
re We describe the deep learning algorithms in detail in Appendix E2. Based on the
segmentation results of lungs and lesions, the workstation provided a quantitative measure of lung opacification percentage (Figure 2).
Accurate segmentation of the lung opacities was the basis for quantitative analysis. Hence, all segmentation results derived from this deep-learning algorithm were visually
p evaluated by two radiologists (one with 7 years of experience in cardiopulmonary imaging
and another with 8 years of experience in pulmonary imaging), who viewed the segmentation independently. Both radiologists were blinded to the patient's clinical status. The scoring procedure was as follows: both radiologists reviewed the segmentation results displayed as
Inregions of interest overlaid on the CT images slice-by-slice. The readers did not adjust the
automatic segmentation. The readers used a scoring criteria based on the adequacy of the segmentation task versus actual lung opacification. Specifically, the degree of matching was

quantified using a Likert score from 0 to 5. The scoring criteria is described in detail in Appendix E3. To reduce the subjectivity of the radiologist's evaluation, the final score of was the average of two scores for each scan. A final score ≥ 3 was considered as sufficient to meet the quantitative analysis requirement.
Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 23.0, IBM statistics, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were expressed as counts (percentage), and
s continuous variable as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range). Normality of distribution
was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The difference between two paired groups
s were assessed by paired t-test or Wilcoxon tests. Moreover, Comparisons among different
clinical types were performed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test. Comparison between any of the two clinical types were performed by t-test or Mann-Whitney
re U test with continuous variable, or χ2 test with categorical variable. Low frequency variables
were compared with Fisher exact test. Two-side P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
p Clinical characteristics
One hundred and forty-eight patients with COVID-19 were initially enrolled, with 9 (6.1%) patients excluded due to respiratory motion artifacts and 13 (8.7%) excluded due to insufficient segmentation quality as determined by the scoring from the two radiologists (i.e.,
Inmean score < 3). Finally, a total of 126 patients (mean age, 52 years ± 15 years; age range,
14-86 years; 53.2% males) with COVID-19 were included. Baseline characteristics of COVID-19 patients are summarized in Table 1. All patients were classified into four clinical

types, including 6 mild cases (4.8%), 94 moderate cases (74.6%), 20 severe cases (15.8%) and 6 critical cases (4.8%). The median of interval between baseline and 1st follow-up was 4 days (interquartile range 3-6 days), and the median of interval between the 1st and 2nd followup was 5 days (interquartile range 3-7 days).
Age and gender had no significant difference among the different clinical types of COVID-19 (P > 0.05). Duration between onset symptoms and initial CT scanning of mild and moderate type patients were shorter than those of severe and critical type (all P<0.01). In 117 patients of 126 (92.9%), fever was the initial symptom, while dyspnea was only observed
s in severe and critical types. Of the laboratory findings, WBC count, lymphocyte count, high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) showed
s significant differences among the four clinical types of patients (all P<0.05). Compared to
critical type patients, WBC count and hs-CRP were significantly lower in moderate type cases (both P<0.001), but lymphocyte count was higher in the moderate type (P=0.004).
re Quantitative CT Parameters at baseline, 1st and 2nd follow-up CT scans
All 126 patients had two CT scans as per inclusion criteria, and 48 0f 126 (38.1%) patients had three CT scans. 236 of all 300 CT scans (78.6%) has a segmentation quality score in the range of 3~4, and 64 (21.4%) CT scans were in the range of 4~5.
p The distribution of lung opacification percentage of all patients according to days
since onset of symptoms is shown in Figure 2a, and peak lung opacification percentage of whole lung occurred at day 13. Overall, the whole-lung QCT-PLO significantly increased between baseline CT and 1st follow-up CT (median [interquartile range]; 3.6%[0.5%,12.1%]
Invs 8.7%[2.7%,21.2%], P < 0.01). No significant progression of whole-lung QCT-PLO was
noted between the 1st follow-up and 2nd follow-up CT (8.7% [2.7%,21.2%] vs 6.0%

[1.9%,24.3%], P=0.655). Percentage changes in the CT derived opacification parameters of the 1st and 2nd follow-up are shown in Table 2.
Quantitative CT opacification parameters in different clinical type of COVID-19 patients Differences in whole-lung QCT-PLO according to clinical severity subtype and days since onset of symptoms at the baseline CT is showed in Figure 2b.
Significant differences of QCT-PLO were found among the four different clinical
s types at the baseline and at the 1st follow-up (all P<0.05, Table 3). All of the 6 mild COVID-
19 patients had negative CTs at the baseline, and were found positive at the 1st follow-up CT
s scan (Figure 3). QCT-PLO of right and left lower lobes were elevated in the 2nd follow-up
CT scan (both P < 0.05, Table E1). Compared to baseline CT scan, whole-lung and per lobe QCT-PLO increased significantly in moderate type patients (all P < 0.05, supplement 3)
re (Figure 4), while no remarkable difference was found between the 1st and 2nd follow-up
scans (all P > 0.05, Table E2). In severe and critical type patients, the whole-lung and per lobe QCT-PLO showed no significant differences between baseline, 1st, or 2nd follow-up CTs (Figures 5 and 6, respectively).
p Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the longitudinal changes of pneumonia severity in different clinical types COVID-19 at baseline and follow-up imaging using a quantitative image parameter (QCT-PLO), which was automatically generated by a deep-learning tool from
Inchest CT scans. Our major findings were: (a) This quantitative parameter based on deep
learning could identify differences in the lung opacity burden on CTs from COVID-19 patients of different clinical severities; (b) Overall, the whole lung and per lobe QCT-PLO at

the 1st follow-up CT increased in comparison with the baseline scans (median interval 4 days), while no remarkable progress was found at the 2nd follow-up (median interval 5 days).
Mild and moderate COVID-19 patients had shorter duration between onset symptoms and initial CT scan, which indicates that these patients could have presented at a relative early stage of disease. This was confirmed by the lower whole-lung and per lobe QCT-PLO at baseline CT. SpO2 of all severe and critical type patients were less than 90% and more than half had dyspnea, which concords to the higher lung opacification percentage assessed by the deep-learning tool. According to prior studies (9,10), severe and critical type patients had
s multiple GGO with consolidation, which can lead to ventilatory dysfunction and even
respiratory failure. Moreover, hs-CRP was significantly elevated in severe and critical type
s patients, which indicates an inflammatory type of response. We observed in our data that whole-lung and per lobe QCT-PLO were higher at the 1st follow up than at baseline, suggesting a sustained progression of imaging findings from
re presentation, plateauing on the 2nd follow-up CT. Such pattern could be attributed to many
factors, including characteristics of our cohort, clinical severity at admission, treatment effect, and the natural history of disease. Depending on the initial clinical type and time of scan, patients could present at any of the stages described here. A combined analysis of our quantitative results suggests that pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 ramps up after the
p beginning of symptoms, peaking at 13 days, which is in keeping with prior a prior
observation (11). There are several limitations of the present study. First, not all patients had a serial of
three CT scans, therefore we cannot systemically evaluate the changes for all patients at the
In1st and 2nd follow up. Second, there was no systematic confirmation of the pulmonary
opacities as being directly caused by the pathological effects of the coronavirus. Last, although the commercial software can quantitatively evaluate lung opacification percentage,

the current version still needs radiologists’ supervision. Noticeably, 8.7% (13/148) of the cases had insufficient segmentation quality to ensure appropriate quantification.
In conclusion, the pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 could be objectively assessed by deep-learning-based quantitative CT. This automated tool may be used for
In press quantifying the disease burden and monitoring disease progression or response to treatment.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS
Appendix E1 Clinical classification of COVID-19 According to Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol of Novel Coronavirus (trial version 5th) from National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China [1], COVID-19 pneumonia was classified into four types, including mild, moderate, severe and critical types. The detailed information is following:
(1) Mild type: Patients have mild clinical symptoms without CT findings of pneumonia.
s (2) Moderate type: Patients have fever and respiratory symptoms with CT findings of pneumonia.
s (3) Severe type: Patients are confirmed this type, if they had any of following criteria, (a) respiratory distress (respiratory rate≥30bpm), (b) SpO2 ≤93% at rest, (c) Pa O2/FiO2≤300mmHg(1mmHg=0.133kPa)
re (4) Critical type: Patients are confirmed this type, if they had any of following criteria, (a) respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation, (b) shock, (c) combined with other organs dysfunction with ICU therapy.
Appendix E2 Development of deep learning algorithms
p InferReadTM CT Pneumonia consists of three modules: (a) lung and lobes region extraction
module; (b) pneumonia segmentation module; (c) quantitative analysis module. The algorithms used in (a) and (b) were based on deep learning. In this study, the development process of the deep learning algorithm of pneumonia segmentation was mainly described.
InSpecially, the deep learning algorithm employed a popular convolutional neural network
architecture of U-Net [2] and was trained using a annotated dataset of COVID-19.

A total of 842 patients (all confirmed to have COVID-19) were collected retrospectively for lung opacity segmentation training and testing, who underwent chest CT scans between 10 January 2020 and 25 January 2020 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. This data set did not overlap with the dataset in the body of this study. Among them, 774 cases were randomly selected for training the U-Net, and other 68 patients were used for testing.
Manual segmentation for lung opacities was performed by two radiologists (not the same person as the two radiologists who evaluated the score in the body of the study) in a consensus reading using InferScholarTM Center (InfervisionTM, Beijing, China). To reduce
s time consumption of manual annotation, radiologists segmented lung opacities every five
slices on the training dataset. In the testing dataset, manual annotation was performed in a
s slice-by-slice manner. In the end, 14,482 slices were annotated in the training set and 5,303
slices were annotated in the test set. The U-Net architecture (shown in Figure E1) consisted of a downsampling path and
re an upsampling path, which reduced the 512 × 512 input image to a 16 × 16 × 256 feature map
to capture context and features, and then upsampled it into a 512 × 512 × 2 output for precise lesion localization. In the downsampling path, each step consisted of a series of 3 × 3 convolutions, which followed by a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, and a 2 × 2 max-pooling layer. In the upsampling path, each of the first three steps combined an up-
p sampling operation, a merge layer, and blocks of 3 × 3 convolutions with ReLU. The final
step in the upsampling path consisted of a upsampling layer and a convolution with a 1 × 1 × 2 kernel followed by a softmax function, which output a score for each of the two classes (background and pneumonia lesion). The final segmentation was obtained by selecting the
Inclass with the highest softmax score for each pixel. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to evaluate segmentation performance, and defined as DSC=2TP / (FP + 2TP +FN), where TP, FP, and FN are the numbers of true

positive, false positive, and false negative detections, respectively. The segmentation performance was evaluated on the testing dataset, and the median DSC and range was 0.8481 (0.6526 - 0.9094).
Appendix E3 Radiologists evaluation Radiologists reviewed the segmentation results overlaid each CT image. The scoring criteria were based on the agreement between the results of the automatic segmentation task and the actual lung opacities. The degree of matching was described in a Likert score from 0 to 5
s (Figure E2). A score of 0 was assigned in two cases (Figure E2a), corresponding to large
areas of false positive or false negative contours in at least one slice or medium-sized area of
s false positive or false negative contours in at least three slices. Under the condition that score
0 was not met, if at least one slice had a medium-sized area of false positive or false negative contours, it was defined as score 1. Score 3 indicated that there were no obvious false positive
re or false negative contours on all sliced (Figure E2b). Score 5 indicated that segmentation
results had a perfect fit to actual lung opacification on all slices (Figure E2c). Score 2 and score 4 were assigned to intermediate conditions that did not meet the predefined criteria above.
For the scans included in the analysis, we calculated the distribution of the scores and
p compared the consistency among the radiologists’ scores. Radiologist 1 assigned a score of 3
in 32 (10.6%), score of 4 in 212 (70.6%), and a score 5 in 56 CTs (18.8%). Radiologist 2 assinged a score of 3 in 35 (11.6%), a score of 4 in 212 (70.6%), and score 5 in 56 CTs
In(18.8%). The kappa coefficient [3] between the two radiologists was 0.75.

path, which reduced the input image to map for capturing context and features, and then upsampled for opacity segmentation. In the example, a 55-year-old male who underwent
re chest CT scan for COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR. InferReadTM CT Pneumonia outlined

In p Figure E2: Examples of different scores. a. Example of a score of 0. The deep-learning
algorithm did not correctly segmented the ground glass opacity in the left lower lobe. The occurrence of such pattern in at least three slices results in a score of 0. b. Example of a score

of 3. Deep-learning algorithm satisfactory segmentation of the lung opacity in the right lower lobe, with minimal imperfections. The occurrence of such pattern in all slices, the scan score is 3. c. Example of score 5. Deep learning algorithms perfectly segment opacities of the lung.
In press When the segmentation results of most slices in a scan meet this situation, the scan score is 5.
