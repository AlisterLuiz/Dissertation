Abstract
This paper describes the initial COVID-19 open image data collection. It was created by assembling medical images from websites and publications and currently contains 123 frontal view X-rays.

1. Motivation
In the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, is it crucial to streamline diagnosis. Data is the ﬁrst step to developing any diagnostic tool or treatment. While there exist large public datasets of more typical chest X-rays (Wang et al., 2017; Bustos et al., 2019; Irvin et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2019; Demner-Fushman et al., 2016), there is no collection of COVID-19 chest X-rays or CT scans designed to be used for computational analysis.
In this paper, we describe the public database of pneumonia cases with chest X-ray or CT images, speciﬁcally COVID19 cases as well as MERS, SARS, and ARDS. Data will be collected from public sources in order not to infringe patient conﬁdentiality. Example images shown in Figure 1.
Our team believes that this database can dramatically improve identiﬁcation of COVID-19. Notably, this would provide essential data to train and test a Deep Learningbased system, likely using some form of transfer learning. These tools could be developed to identify COVID-19 characteristics as compared to other types of pneumonia or in order to predict survival.
Currently, all images and data are released under the following URL: https://github.com/ieee8023/ covid-chestxray-dataset. As stated above, images collected have already been made public.
2. Expected outcome
This dataset can be used to study the progress of COVID-19 and how its radiological ﬁndings vary from other types of

pneumonia. Similarly to the outcome of the Chest Xray14 (Wang et al., 2017) dataset which enabled signiﬁcant advances in medical imaging, tools can be developed to predict not only the type of pneumonia, but also its outcome. Eventually, our model could take inspiration from work by Rajpurkar et al. (2017), which could predict pneumonia, as well as Cohen et al. (2019), which deployed such models.
Tools could be built to triage cases in the absence of physical tests, particularly in the context of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests shortage (Satyanarayana, 2020; Kelly Geraldine Malone, 2020). These tools could predict patient outcomes such as survival, allowing a physician to plan ahead for speciﬁc patients and facilitate management. In extreme situations, where physicians could be faced with the extraordinary decision to choose which patient should be allocated healthcare resources (Yascha Mounk, 2020), such a tool could potentially serve as a measuring device.

Furthermore, these tools could monitor the progression of COVID-19 positive patients in order to better track the evolution of their condition. Ultimately, this dataset and its analysis could help us better understand the dynamics of the disease and better prepare treatments.
3. Dataset
The current statistics as of March 25th 2020 are shown in Table 1. For each image, attributes shown in Table 2 are collected. Data is largely compiled from websites such as Radiopaedia.org, the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology1, and Figure1.com2. Images are extracted from online publications, website, or directly from the PDF using the tool pdﬁmages3. The goal during this process is to maintain the quality of the images.
Data was collected from the following papers: (Phan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Paul et al., 2004; Silverstein et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Holshue et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Kong & Agarwal, 2020; Lim et al., 2020; Zu et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2020; jin Zhang et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2020; Hsih et al., 2020; Cuong et al., 2020; Thevarajan et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020)
