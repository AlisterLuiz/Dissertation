Background:  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has widely spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020. It is desirable to develop automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using chest CT.
Purpose:  To develop a fully automatic framework to detect COVID-19 using chest CT and evaluate its performance.
Materials and Methods:  In this retrospective and multicenter study, a deep learning model, the COVID-19 detection neural network (COVNet), was developed to extract visual features from volumetric chest CT scans for the detection of COVID-19. CT scans of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were included to test the robustness of the model. The datasets were collected from six hospitals between August 2016 and February 2020. Diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity.
Results:  The collected dataset consisted of 4352 chest CT scans from 3322 patients. The average patient age (6standard deviation) was 49 years 6 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 in the independent test set was 90% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%; 114 of 127 scans) and 96% (95% CI: 93%, 98%; 294 of 307 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (P , .001). The per-scan sensitivity and specificity for detecting CAP in the independent test set was 87% (152 of 175 scans) and 92% (239 of 259 scans), respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97).
Conclusion:  A deep learning model can accurately detect coronavirus 2019 and differentiate it from community-acquired pneumonia and other lung conditions.

Summary
Deep learning detected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and distinguished it from community-acquired pneumonia and other non-pneumonia lung diseases using chest CT.
Key Results
n A deep learning method was able to identify coronavirus disease 2019 on chest CT scans (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.96).
n A deep learning method was able to identify community-acquired pneumonia on chest CT scans (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.95).
n There was overlap in the chest CT imaging findings of all viral pneumonias with other chest diseases that encourages a multidisciplinary approach to the final diagnosis used for patient treatment.

the 1551 patients with CAP, 210 received laboratory confirmation of the origin: 112 were confirmed to be bacterial culture positive and 98 were confirmed to be negative (65 mycoplasma and 31 viral pneumonia).
Patients with other non-pneumonia abnormalities had no lung disease (n = 510) or had lung nodules (n = 552), chronic inflammation (n = 264), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 115), or other diseases (n = 14, including pneumothorax and tracheal diverticulum).
Patients with CAP and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were randomly selected from the participating hospitals between August 16, 2016, and February 17, 2020. All scans were randomly split with a ratio of 9:1 into a training set and an independent testing set at the patient level. The training dataset was then further split for training the model and internal validation (10% of the samples). The independent testing set was not used for training and internal validation. The patient demographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. The patient disease statistics are summarized in Table 2.

Materials and Methods
Patients This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committees of the participating hospitals. The need to obtain written informed consent for participation in this study was waived. Our study includes 4563 three-dimensional (3D) volumetric chest CT scans from 3506 patients acquired at six medical centers between August 16, 2016, and February 17, 2020 (Fig 1). The exclusion criteria included (a) contrast material–enhanced CT scans and (b) scans with slice thickness greater than 3 mm. After applying the exclusion criteria, 4352 3D chest CT scans from 3322 patients were selected for this study (Fig 1). The average patient age (6standard deviation) was 49 years 6 15, and there were slightly more men than women (1838 vs 1484, respectively; P = .29). CT scans with multiple reconstruction kernels at the same imaging session or acquired at multiple time points were included. Of the 4352 scans in the final dataset, 1292 (30%) were obtained for COVID-19, 1735 (40%) for CAP, and 1325 (30%) for non-pneumonia abnormalities. All cases of COVID-19 were confirmed as positive with RT-PCR and were acquired from December 31, 2019, to February 17, 2020.
The median period from the symptom onset to the first chest CT examination was 7 days (range, 0–20 days). The most common symptoms were fever (81%, 381 of 468 patients) and cough (66%, 309 of 468 patients). For each patient, one or multiple CT examinations were performed at several time points during the course of the disease (average number of CT examinations per patient, 1.8; range, 1–6).
Patients with CAP and other non-pneumonia abnormalities were randomly selected from the participating hospitals between August 16, 2016, and February 17, 2020. The admission distribution of the patients with CAP was as follows: outpatient, 46% (713 of 1551); inpatient, 38% (588 of 1551); emergency, 3% (40 of 1551); and physical examination, 3% (46 of 1551). Of

Imaging Protocol CT scans were obtained with equipment from different manufacturers by using standard imaging protocols. Each volumetric scan contains 51–1094 CT slices with a varying slice thickness of 0.5–3 mm. The reconstruction matrix was 512 3 512 pixels with in-plane pixel spatial resolution ranging from 0.29 3 0.29 mm2 to 0.98 3 0.98 mm2. Please refer to Table E1 (online) for details.
Deep Learning Model We developed a 3D deep learning framework for the detection of COVID-19, referred to as COVNet (Fig 2). It is able to extract both two-dimensional local and 3D global representative features. The COVNet framework consists of RestNet50 (16) as the backbone, which takes a series of CT slices as input and generates features for the corresponding slices. The extracted features from all slices are then combined by using a max-pooling operation. The final feature map is fed to a fully connected layer and softmax activation function to generate a probability score for each type (COVID-19, CAP, and non-pneumonia).
Specifically, given a 3D CT scan, we first preprocess it and extract the lung region as the region of interest by using a Unet (17) based segmentation method. The preprocessed image is then passed to our COVNet for the predictions. The code to reproduce the results in this study is available at https://github. com/bkong999/COVNet.git. Please refer to Appendix E1 (online) for the details.
Statistical Analysis The performance of our trained deep learning model was evaluated by using an independent testing set, which was not used during model development. Statistical analysis was performed with using R software (version 3.6.3). Analysis of variance tests and x2 tests were used to compare differences among different groups for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Two-sided P , .05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The sensitivity and specificity for both

Results
Study Population Characteristics Table 1 lists the study population characteristics for the training and independent testing datasets. There are slightly more male patients than female patients across COVID-19, CAP, and non-pneumonia groups for both the training dataset (percentage of male patients: COVID-19, 53% [212 of 400 patients]; CAP, 56% [782 of 1396 patients]; nonpneumonia, 55% [645 of 1173 patients]; P = .55) and the independent testing dataset (percentage of male patients: COVID-19, 52% [35 of 68 patients]; CAP, 62% [96 of 155 patients]; non-pneumonia, 52% [68 of 130 patients]; P = .17). Patients in the COVID-19 and CAP groups were older than those in the non-pneumonia group for the training dataset (mean age: COVID-19, 53 years; CAP, 51 years;

non-pneumonia, 41 years; P , .001) and the independent testing dataset (mean age: COVID-19, 52 years; CAP, 53 years; non-pneumonia, 41 years; P , .001).
Model Performance Once the deep learning model is trained, the processing time for a new testing examination is very fast. The average processing time for each CT examination was 4.51 seconds with a workstation (GPU NVIDIA Quadro M4000 [Nvidia, Santa Clara, Calif ], 8GB, RAM 16GB, and Intel Xeon Processor E5–1620 v4 @3.5GHz).
The performance of COVNet in the detection of COVID-19 and CAP is summarized in Table 3. The sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 are 90% (114 of 127 scans; 95% CI: 83%, 94%; P , .001) and 96% (294 of 307 scans; 95% CI: 93%, 98%; P , .001), respectively. For the detection of CAP, our deep learning model yielded a sensitivity of 87% (152 of 175 scans; 95% CI: 81%, 91%; P , .001) and a specificity of 92% (239 of 259 scans; 95% CI, 88%, 95%; P , .001).

Note.—Two-hundred ten patients with CAP received laboratory confirmation of the disease cause. CAP = community-acquired pneumonia, CHF = congestive heart failure, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease 2019, NA = not available, RT-PCR = reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.

COVID-19 and CAP are 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97), respectively.
To improve the interpretability of our model, we adopted the gradient-weighted class activation mapping, or Grad-CAM, method (19), to visualize the important regions leading to the decision of the deep learning model. Such a localization map is fully generated by the model without additional manual annotation. Figure 4 shows the heatmap to the suspected regions for the examples of COVID, CAP, and non-pneumonia abnormalities. These heatmaps illustrate that our algorithm paid most attention to the abnormal regions while ignoring the normal-like regions as shown in the non-pneumonia abnormality example.
In addition, Figure 5 shows one representative example of a case of CAP that was misclassified as COVID-19 and Figure 6 shows another example of a COVID-19 case that was misclassified as CAP. The consecutive slices around the abnormality are shown from left to right on each row. It seems that these are very challenging cases. It might be useful to include the history of exposure to further improve the accuracy.

Discussion
In this study, we designed and evaluated a three-dimensional deep learning model for detecting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from chest CT scans. On an independent testing data set, we showed that this model achieved high sensitivity (90% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 83%, 94%]) and high specificity (96% [95% CI: 93%, 98%]) in the detection of COVID-19. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia were 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.99) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.97), respectively.
In this study, a 3D deep learning framework was proposed for the detection of COVID-19. This framework can extract both two-dimensional local and 3D global representative features. Deep learning has achieved superior performance in the field of radiology (10–13). Previous studies have successfully applied deep learning techniques to detect pneumonia on pediatric chest radiographs and further to differentiate viral and bacterial pneumonia on two-dimensional pediatric chest radiographs (12,13). We were able to collect a large number of CT scans from multiple hospitals,

which included 1292 COVID-19 CT scans. More importantly, 1735 CAP and 1325 non-pneumonia CT scans were also collected as the control groups in this study to ensure the detection robustness considering that certain similar imaging features may be observed in COVID-19 and other types of lung diseases.
COVID-19 has widely spread all over the world since the first case was detected at the end of 2019. Early diagnosis of the disease is important for treatment and to isolate the patients to prevent the virus spread. RT-PCR is considered the reference standard; however, it has been reported that chest CT could be used as a reliable and rapid approach for screening of COVID-19 (5,6). The abnormal CT findings in COVID-19 have been recently reported to include ground-glass opacification, consolidation, bilateral involvement, and peripheral and diffuse distribution (1–5,7,8).
This study has several limitations. First, COVID-19 is caused by a corona virus and may have similar imaging characteristics as pneumonia caused by other types of viruses. However, due to the lack of laboratory confirmation of the origin for each of these cases, we were not able to select other viral pneumonias for comparison in this study. Instead, we randomly selected CAP from August 2016 to February 2020.

We propose that our sampling method was sufficient for the typical distribution of various subtypes of CAP. These cases should have included non–COVID-19 viral pneumonias (eg, influenza virus), bacterial pneumonia, and organizing pneumonia from any cause. It would be desirable to test the performance of COVNet in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonias that have real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmation of the viral agent in a future study. Second, a disadvantage of all deep learning methods is the lack of transparency and interpretability (eg, it is impossible to determine what imaging features are being used to determine the output). While we used a heatmap to visualize the important regions in the scans leading to the decision of the algorithm, heatmaps are still not sufficient to visualize what unique features are used by the model to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP. Third, there is a great deal of overlap in how the lung responds to various insults and a significant amount of overlap in the presentation of many diseases in the lung that depend on host factors (eg, age, drug reactivity, immune status, underlying comorbidities). No one method will be able to differentiate all lung diseases based simply on the imaging appearance on chest CT scans. A multidisciplinary approach for this is recommended. Furthermore, although a

Each plot illustrates the receiver operating characteristic curve of the algorithm (black curve) on the independent testing set for (a) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (P , .001), (b) community-acquired pneumonia, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (P , .001), and (c) non-pneumonia, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 (P , 0.001).

large amount of data were collected in this study, the test set came from the same hospitals as the training set. We plan to collect additional CT scans from different centers to evaluate its performance in the near future. Finally, this study focused on whether one scan is COVID-19; it did not address the categorization of the disease into different severities. As a next step, it would be important to not only predict the presence of COVID-19, but also the severity degree to further help monitor and treat patients.
In conclusion, a robust deep learning model is developed to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from chest CT scans. These results demonstrate that a machine learning approach using a convolutional networks model has the ability to distinguish COVID-19 from CAP.
