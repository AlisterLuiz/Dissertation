45 Abstract
46 Background: Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing 2019 47 novel coronavirus (COVID19) pneumonia. Our research aimed to construct a system based on 48 deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working 49 pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. 50 Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted 51 patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control 52 patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, 53 China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients 54 undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively 55 collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia 56 with that of the model. 57 Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy 58 of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 59 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 60 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. 61 With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. 62 Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, 63 and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice. It holds great potential to 64 relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, improve early diagnosis, isolation and treatment, and 65 thus contribute to the control of the epidemic. 66 Keywords: 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, Deep learning, Computed tomography

67 Introduction

68 In December 2019, a new coronavirus infection disease (hereinafter referred to as COVID-19) was

69 first reported in Wuhan. Subsequently, the outbreak began to spread widely in China and even

70 abroad.[1-3]

71

The clinical manifestations of the COVID-19 pneumonia is complicated and could be

72 characterized as fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms onset.[4]

73 Although the nucleic acid detection was considered determinant for identifying the COVID-19

74 infection and more rapid detection kit for the novel coronavirus has come into mass production,

75 computed tomography (CT) scan is still the most efficient modality for detecting and evaluating

76 the severity of pneumonia.[5] An update series demonstrate that CT findings were positive in all

77 140 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, even in the early stage.[4,6] In the fifth version of

78 diagnostic manual of COVID-19 launched by the National Health and Health Commission of

79 China, the radiographic characteristics of pneumonia was included the clinical diagnostic standard

80 in Hubei Province.[7] Subsequently, 14,840 new cases of COVID-19 were reported within one

81 day on Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, including 13332 cases of clinical diagnoses.[8] This highlighted

82 the importance of CT in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

83

Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19, thousands of patients waited in line for CT

84 examination in the designated fever outpatient hospital at Wuhan and other cities. As of Feb 14,

85 there are 5,534 suspected cases, 38,107 confirmed patients receiving treatment in hospital, and

86 77,323 cases under medical observation in Hubei province.[9] Most of them need to undergo CT

87 examination, however, there are less than 4,500 radiologists in cities of Hubei according to the

88 China Health Statistical Yearbook (2018).[10] Meanwhile, because the lung infection foci are

89 small in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection, thinner layer (2.5mm, 1.25mm or even

90 0.625mm) scanning were usually needed instead of conventional CT scan (5 mm) for diagnosis,

91 which would be more time-consuming. All these made radiologists overloaded, delay the

92 diagnosis and isolation of patients, affect patient’s treatment and prognosis, and ultimately, affect

93 the control of COVID-19 epidemic.

94

Deep learning, an important breakthrough in the domain of AI in the past decade, has huge

95 potential at extracting tiny features in image analysis.[11] Our group also succeeded in recruiting

96 this technique in minor lesion detection and real-time assistance to doctors in gastrointestinal

97 endoscopy.[12-16]

98

In the present research, we construct and validate a system based on deep learning for

99 identification of viral pneumonia on CT. Our model has comparable performance with expert

100 radiologist, but take much less time.

101

102 Method

103 Patients

104 We first retrospectively collected 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including

105 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other

106 diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) for model

107 development. The patients’ CT scan images and reports, history, clinical manifestations, physical

108 findings, and viral pathogen results were all collected. For prospective patients, 27 consecutive

109 patients undergoing CT scans were enrolled in the designated CT rooms in Feb 5, 2020 in Renmin

110 Hospital of Wuhan University.

111

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

112 Written informed consent was provided by all prospective participants. Because of virus

113 contamination, the signed informed consents were carefully sealed and kept in the specific place

114 according to the Law of the People's Republic of China on Infectious Disease Prevention and

115 Control.[17] For patients whose CT scans were stored in the retrospective databases, informed

116 consent was waived by the Ethics Committee.

117

118 Diagnostic testing for COVID-19

119 Patient's respiratory secretions were collected and transferred to a sterile test tube with a virus

120 transport medium. Fluorescent RT-PCR analysis of samples was performed using the COVID-19

121 nucleic acid detection kit developed by Shanghai Geneodx Biotechnology Co., Ltd. This detection

122 kit was approved by the US National Drug Administration (NMPA) on January 26, 2019 and

123 recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[18] The rapid,

124 high-precision COVID-19 detection kit greatly accelerated the confirmation of human COVID-19

125 infection.

126

127 Datasets

128 As shown in Figure 1, a total of 46,096 CT scan images from 51 COVID-19 pneumonia patients

129 and 55 control patients of other disease were collected for developing the model to detect

130 COVID-19 pneumonia. After filtering those images without good lung fields, 35355 images were

131 selected and split into training and retrospectively testing datasets. Enrolled images in training

132 dataset covered almost all common CT features of COVID19 pneumonia, as presented in Figure 2.

133 Three radiologists with more than 5 years of clinical experience labelled infection lesions of 134 COVID-19 pneumonia patients in training dataset, and selected images containing COVID19 135 pneumonia lesions in testing set, and their labels were combined by consensus. For prospectively 136 testing the model, 13,911 images of 27 consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb 5, 2020 137 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were further collected. All CT scans were obtained in 138 Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The instruments used in this study included Optima CT680, 139 Revolution CT and Bright Speed CT scanner (all GE Healthcare). 140 141 Training algorithm 142 UNet++, a novel and powerful architecture for medical image segmentation was implemented to 143 develop the model.[19,20] We first trained UNet++ to extract valid areas in CT images using 289 144 randomly selected CT images and tested it in other 600 randomly selected CT images. The 145 training images were labelled with the smallest rectangle containing all valid areas by researchers. 146 The model successfully extracted valid areas in 600 images in testing set with an accuracy of 147 100%. For detecting suspicious lesions on CT scans, 691 images of COVID-19 pneumonia 148 infection lesions labelled by radiologists and 300 images randomly selected from patients of 149 non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. Taking the raw CT scan images as input with a resolution 150 of 512×512, and the labelled map from the expert as output, UNet++ was used to train in Keras in 151 an image-to-image manner. The suspicious region was predicted under a confidence cutoff value 152 of 0.50, and a prediction box pixel of over 25. The training curves of UNet++ for extracting valid 153 areas and detecting suspicious lesions in CT images were shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and 154 Supplementary Figure 2, respectively. The prediction schematic of the model was shown in

155 Figure 3. Raw images were firstly input into the model, and after processing of the model, 156 prediction boxes framing suspicious lesions were output. Valid areas were further extracted and 157 unnecessary fields were filter out to avoid possible false positives. To predict by case, a logic 158 linking the prediction results of consecutive images was added. CT images with the above 159 prediction results were divided into four quadrants, and results would be output only when three 160 consecutive images were predicted to have lesions in the same quadrant. 161 162 Testing of the model in retrospective data 163 To evaluate the performance of the model on CT scan images, five metrics including the accuracy, 164 sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were calculated as follows: accuracy = true predictions/total 165 number of cases, sensitivity = true positive/positive, specificity = true negative/negative, positive 166 prediction value (PPV) = true positive/(true positive + false positive), negative prediction value 167 (NPV) = true negative/(true negative + false negative). The “true positive” is the number of 168 correctly predicted COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images, “false positive” is the number of 169 mistakenly predicted COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images, “positive” is the number of 170 cases/images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients, “true negative” is the number of correctly 171 predicted non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images, “false negative” is the number of mistakenly 172 predicted non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images and ‘negative’ is the number of 173 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases/images enrolled. For image-based metrics, 636 images 174 containing infection lesions identified by radiologists among 11 patients of COVID-19 pneumonia 175 were used as the positive sample, and 9369 CT scan images from 31 patients of non-COVID-19 176 pneumonia were used as the negative sample.

177 Evaluating the efficiency of radiologist in traditional way 178 To evaluate the performance and cost of time of radiologist against 2019-CoV pneumonia, 179 prospectively consecutive patients undergoing CT scans were enrolled in the designated CT rooms 180 in Feb 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. An expert radiologist was required to 181 read all CT images of enrolled patients using the working computer, and determine if each patient 182 has viral pneumonia. The research assistant used a stopwatch to record the expert’s reading time. 183 The expert radiologist was associate chief physician of the Radiology Department of Renmin 184 Hospital of Wuhan University, with clinical experience of 30 years, and independently diagnosed 185 about 300 viral pneumonia. Hospitalized viral pneumonia cases judged by radiologists were all 186 diagnosed using COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit to confirm COVID-19 infection. The 187 computed radiography imaging system used by the radiologist was VisionPACS (Intechhosun, 188 Being, China). 189 190 Comparison between the model and radiologist in prospective data 191 The CT scan images of the prospective patients as above were collected and imported into the 192 model for prediction. The model’s performance and cost of time were compared with that of the 193 expert radiologist. Inconsistent results between the expert and model were reviewed by three 194 radiologists, including the expert and other two radiologists, senior staff members of the 195 Radiology Department of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, with clinical experience about 196 10 years, and independently diagnosed about 150 viral pneumonia. 197 198 Evaluating the efficiency of radiologist with the assistance of AI

199 To evaluate the performance and cost of time of radiologist against 2019-CoV pneumonia with the 200 assistance of our model, the prediction results of the model (whether a patient has viral pneumonia, 201 and labels marking lesions) were copied to the working computer in the designated CT rooms. 202 After 10 days of wash out period (in Feb 16, 2020), the same expert radiologist was required to 203 re-read all CT images of 27 prospective patients using the working computer where results of the 204 model could be viewed, and determine if each patient has viral pneumonia. The research assistant 205 used a stopwatch to record the expert’s reading time again. Hospitalized viral pneumonia cases 206 judged by radiologists were all diagnosed using COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit to confirm 207 COVID-19 infection. The computed radiography imaging system used by the radiologist was 208 VisionPACS (Intechhosun, Being, China). 209 210 Statistical analysis 211 A two-tailed paired Student's t test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to compare 212 differences in the cost time of the model and radiologist. 213 214 Role of the funding sources 215 The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data 216 interpretation, or writing of the report.

235 The performance of the model on retrospective dataset

236 Among 4382 CT images from 11 patients of COVID-19 pneumonia and 9369 images from 31

237 control patients, the model correctly diagnosed the patients with a per-patient sensitivity of 100%,

238 specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%. A per-image

239 sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of

240 99.61%. Representative images predicted by the model were shown in Figure 4.

244 diagnosed as viral pneumonia by the expert radiologist, and the other eleven patients were not.

245 Two other radiologists reviewed the CT imaging, approved the expert’s results, and summarized

246 that the CT characteristics of the 11 patients not diagnosed by the expert include 5 ground glass

247 nodules, 3 diminutive nodules, 2 normal and 1 fibrosclerosis.

248

The model successfully detected all the 16 patients of viral pneumonia diagnosed by the

249 expert. Among the other 11 patients, 2 were also detected by the model. The predictions in one

250 case was fibrosclerosis lesion, and the other one was normal stomach bubble. Using results of the

251 radiologists as the gold standard, the model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, accuracy

252 of 92.59%, specificity of 81.82%, PPV of 88.89% and NPV of 100% in the 27 prospective patients.

253 Among the 16 patients diagnosed as viral pneumonia by radiologists, 8 admitted patients were

254 confirmed as COVID-19 infection, and the others were outpatients that difficult to follow nucleic

255 acid results. The average prediction time for model was 41.34s per patient (IQR 39.76-44.48). The

256 performance of the model on detecting COVID-19 pneumonia was shown in Table 3.

267 determining whether each patient has viral pneumonia were not changed, while the average

268 reading time of the expert was greatly decreased by 65%. This indicates that the efficiency of

269 radiologist could be greatly improved with the assistance of AI.

A website has been made available to provide free access to the present model

271 (http://121.40.75.149/znyx-ncov/index) (Figure 5). CT scan images could be uploaded by both

272 clinicians and researches as a second opinion consulting service, especially in other provinces or

273 countries unfamiliar with the radiologic characteristics of COVID-19. Cases of COVID-19

274 pneumonia were also been made available on the open-access website, which might be a useful

275 resource for radiologists and researchers for fighting COVID-19 pneumonia.

277 DISCUSSION

278

As of Feb 14, 2020, the national health commission had reported 66,492 confirmed cases,

279 1,523 deaths and 8,969 suspected cases.[21] In the face of such large number of patients and high

280 contagiosity of the novel coronavirus (with an estimated reproduction number R0 of 2.2~6.47),

281 timely diagnosis and isolation are the keys to prevent further spread of the virus.[22-26] CT scan

282 is the most efficient modality for screening and clinically diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia.[5,7]

283 However, compared to the needs of the patients, the number of radiologists is quite small,

284 especially in Hubei province, China, which could greatly delay the diagnosis and isolation of

285 patients, affect patient’s treatment and prognosis, and ultimately, affect the overall control of

286 COVID-19 epidemic.

287

Deep learning, a technology has shown great performance on extracting tiny features in

288 radiology data, may hold the promise to alleviate this problem.[11] Recently, Ardila D, et al

289 achieved end-to-end lung cancer screening on low-dose chest CT with an AUC of 94.4%.[27]

290 Chae KJ, et al successfully used the convolutional neural network to classify small (≤2 cm)

291 pulmonary nodules on CT scan images.[28] However, there was rare research being conducted to

292 detect viral pneumonia.[11,27,28] In previous work, our group succeeded in recruiting deep

293 learning in minor lesion detection and real-time assistance to doctors in gastrointestinal

294 endoscopy.[12-16] Here, we enrolled this technique in identification of COVID-19 pneumonia in

295 CT images. Results from both retrospective and prospective patients showed that the model was

296 comparable to the level of expert radiologist, and hold great potential to reduce diagnosing time.

297 (Figure 6)

298

Early diagnosis and early isolation of suspected patients are the most important ways to

299 prevent the spread of epidemic.19 Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID19, the radiology

300 department is overloaded and patients have to wait for long times for chest CT scan, which largely

301 increase the risk of cross-infection. In recent days, radiologists’ daily workload is huge in Hubei

302 province, and a CT scan report has to be awaited several hours to achieve. Based on the number of

303 suspected patients and close contacts in being, radiologists in the hardest hit, Hubei province,

304 China, may not be enough to resist the rapid spread of the virus, which holds high estimated R0 of

305 2.2~6.47.[23-26] It could be inferred that before radiologists fulfilling the demands of existing

306 patients, newly infected cases would appear, and the overall burden of radiologists is more

307 overwhelming like a growing snowball. Relieving the pressure of radiologists is essential for the

308 control of virus spreading. In the present study, our model achieved a comparable performance but

309 with much shorter time compared with expert radiologists. It holds great potential to relieve the

310 pressure of radiologists in clinical practice, and contribute to the control of the epidemic.

311

Timely diagnosis and early treatment of infected patients is important for patients’

312 prognosis.[29] The fatality rate of COVID19 patients in Hubei province is significantly higher

313 than that of other regions, which probably due to delayed treatment and shortage of medical

314 resources.[8,30] Accelerating diagnosis efficiency is significant for improving patient outcomes.

315 In the present study, our model helped expert radiologists achieve the same work with much

316 shorter time, which greatly accelerats the efficiency of diagnosis in clinical practice, and may

317 contribute to the improvement of patient outcome.

318

In addition to relieving radiologists’ pressure and accelerating diagnosis efficiency, artificial

319 intelligence also holds the potential to reduce miss diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The lung 320 infection foci are sometimes mild in the early stage of the COVID-19 infection,5 and requires

321 careful observation under 0.625mm layer scanning. Radiologists vary in skills, and could be

322 affected by subjective status and outside pressure. One miss diagnosis could lead to multiple

323 spread. The model is highly sensitive and stable, and would never be affected by work burden and

324 work time. As a preliminary screening tool, it might help radiologists improve the sensitivity and

325 reduce miss diagnosis.

326

On the basis of the accuracy and efficiency of the model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia,

327 a cloud-based open-access artificial intelligence platform was constructed to provide assistance for

328 detecting COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide. CT scan images could be uploaded freely by both

329 clinicians and researches as an assistant tool, especially in other provinces or countries unfamiliar

330 with the radiologic characteristics of COVID-19. This free open-access website can read images in

331 batches, provide high-level auxiliary diagnostic services for different hospitals in free, and expand

332 the boundaries of regions and manpower. Cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were also been made

333 available on the open-access website, which might be a useful resource for radiologists and

334 researchers for fighting COVID-19 pneumonia.

335

In summary, the deep learning-based model achieved a comparable performance with expert

336 radiologist using much shorter time. It holds great potential to improve the efficiency of diagnosis,

337 relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, accelerates the diagnosis, isolation and treatment of

338 COVID19 patients, and therefore contribute to the control of the epidemic.
